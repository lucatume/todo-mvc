# TodoMVC WordPress theme

*A proof-of-concept* implementation of the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) app using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and [intercooler.js](http://intercoolerjs.org/).

## Not a theme
The theme is not meant to be used as a theme: it's a developer experiment. Feel free to use it and experiment with it but do not expect it to ever pack more than one page.

## Requirements
The theme will require the [wp-routes](https://github.com/lucatume/wp-routes) and the [intercooler.js for WordPress](https://github.com/lucatume/wp-intercooler) plugins; those **do not** come with the theme: download and install them both.
